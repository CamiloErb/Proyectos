Hi! 
This is the app I made for the React job position.
I got a little problem with the trading economics api and I could never get the correct data to make the EUR/USD exchange rate component
so I used another api that does the same, and call it every 60 seconds to update the info. I know this is not the best practice but it was to complete that part of the technical task.
If you want to login there are four users to get the success message:
    username: "Camilo", password: "ortex123"
    username: "Robot163", password: "ortexrules"
    username: "miraclealigner", password: "ortexisthebest"
    username: "melanieee", password: "ortexhiremepls"
Thank you in advance.
